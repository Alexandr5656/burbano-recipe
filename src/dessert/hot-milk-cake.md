## Ingrediants

- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 cups (397g) granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup (67g) vegetable oil or canola oil
- 2 cups (240g) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter
- 1 cup (227g) milk, (whole milk preferred)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Steps

- Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly grease a 9- x 13-inch pan that's at least 2 inches deep.
Beat the eggs and sugar together until they're light and fluffy, about 2 minutes at medium-high
speed using an electric or stand mixer. Slowly beat in the canola oil.

- Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
Add the flour, salt, and baking powder to the egg mixture in the bowl, beating just enough to
combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then beat again, to fully incorporate any
sticky bits.

- In a saucepan set over medium heat, bring the butter and milk just to a boil. Add the vanilla.
Remove the pan from the heat, and stir the mixture until the butter is completely melted.

- Slowly add the hot milk mixture to the cake batter, mixing until everything is well combined.
Scrape the bowl, and mix briefly, just until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

- Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean,
and the top feels set. Remove the cake from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool.
